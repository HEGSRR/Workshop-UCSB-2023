### Product Gap Analysis - Comments About Our Approach and Resources

1. What strategies do you currently use to educate researchers about open science practices? Do you believe these materials could be used to supplement or complement those strategies?
2. Are there any features or components in the template that you found challenging, confusing, or missing?
3. Do the current framework and template address the specific needs of researchers in various sub-disciplines and stages of their spatial data science projects?
4. Are there any emerging trends, technologies, or practices in open science that the current framework and template do not adequately cover?
5. What improvements in research quality and reproducibility could be reasonably expected from researchers who adopt and effectively integrate the template into their research practice?


### Skills Gap Analysis - Plans to Use Open Science Practices in Research and Teaching

#### Identifying and Measuring Important Skills
1. What skills are necessary to effectively implement open science practices, such as data and code sharing and version control?
2. Do you currently assess students' or research assistants' abilities to track and share research data or procedures? If yes, how is this assessment conducted?


#### Performance Indicators and Assessment
1. What impact would you expect increased adoption of open science practices to have on your research quality, collaboration, or visibility?
2. Are there established benchmarks or standards within the open science community that you believe geographic researchers can use to set targets for open science skill proficiency and adoption?
3. What qualitative feedback from researchers and collaborators can be used to refine open science training programs and initiatives?

#### Community Building
1. What are some ways to create a community of practice where geographic researchers can share their experiences and learn from one another's successes and challenges? Would you be interested in joining such a community?
2. What will be some key ways to incentivize and recognize researchers who actively contribute to open science initiatives in geography and spatial data science?

### Workshop Prompts
1. Can you share any successes, advice, or best practices introducing reproducibility and replicability in your spatial data science scholarship (research or teaching)?
2. What barriers do you perceive to adopting open and reproducible research practices in your own scholarship?
3. Could any resources, changes, or incentives help overcome those barriers?
