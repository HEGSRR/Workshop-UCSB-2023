# Reproducible Research Practices for Spatial Data Science

Website:  [sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net](http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/)  
Date: December 7, 2023 
Time: 11:00 am to 1:00 pm EST  
Location: Ellison 2609

## Expected Participation

We anticipate that this tutorial will be interesting and valuable for the following groups:

- Graduate students interested in learning methods from the literature and either publishing reproduction or replication reports or extending prior research in their own master's theses or PhD dissertations.
- Faculty and career researchers interested in adopting more open and reproducible research practices for their own original work, or simply crafting more competitive data management plans and working more efficiently and accurately.
